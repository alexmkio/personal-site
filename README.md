## Overview

**Epitome** is a modern and dynamic personal portfolio website template originally designed by [StyleShout](https://styleshout.com/free-templates/epitome/). This project represents a comprehensive refactoring effort, transforming the original vanilla JS application into a sleek and efficient [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-powered experience.

This is a portfolio site based off of my work with [Epitome](https://github.com/alexmkio/epitome).

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Animation**: Leveraging [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), Epitome delivers a seamless and engaging animate-on-scroll experience.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Integration of [react-scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll) ensures a polished and fluid scrolling behavior for an improved user journey.
- **Dynamic Carousel**: The SlickSlider carousel functionality, powered by [react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick), adds a captivating element to showcase your content.

## Motivation

My motivation for embarking on this project stemmed from the desire to revamp my personal website. While impressed with the StyleShout template, I aimed to create a platform that not only reflected my personal style but also embodied my development philosophy. The core structure of the template remains untouched, allowing users the flexibility to fork it for their unique needs. If you choose to do so, consider supporting the original designers at [StyleShout](https://styleshout.com/free-templates/epitome/).
